MicroArray -
1. Read noOfTestCases.
2. For loop for noOfTestCases.
2. Read the value of N and K.
3. Read all the elements in a array.
4. Declare TimeTaken = 0.
5. Declare NoGreater = false.
6. while loop(count!=noofelements)
6. loop through all elements 
7. Element < K 
8. If true,
	 int diff = K - Element	 
	 Element = Element + diff ;
	 TimeTaken = TimeTaken + diff ;
9. If false, count++
10. Print TimeTaken.
